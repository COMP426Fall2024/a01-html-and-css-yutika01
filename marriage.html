        <h2>The Marriage to the Pandavas</h2>
        <p>Draupadi's marriage is a tale of destiny, divine blessings, and unforeseen circumstances, central to the epic Mahabharata. As a 
            princess of extraordinary beauty and character, her father King Drupada arranged a swayamvara - a ceremony where she could 
            choose her husband from among assembled suitors. 
            <br></br>
            The challenge set for the swayamvara was incredibly difficult. Suitors had to string a mighty bow and shoot five arrows 
            through a rotating fish's eye, using only its reflection in a pool of water below. Many great warriors and princes tried and
             failed. It was Arjuna who accomplished this seemingly impossible feat, winning Draupadi's hand.
            However, when Arjuna and his brothers returned home with Draupadi, they called out to their mother Kunti, announcing they had brought 
            something. She replied without looking, "Whatever it is, share it equally among yourselves." This inadvertent statement, considered a 
            mother's command, set the stage for an unusual marriage arrangement.
             <br></br>
            The situation was further complicated by a statement that Draupadi had received in her previous life. She had loved 
            Lord Shiva so deeply and seeked to be his wife. Honored but unable to grant this wish directly, Shiva had blessed her to have 
            five husbands in her next life.
            <br></br>
            Faced with this complex situation, the Pandavas sought the counsel of wise sages. It was ultimately decided that to honor 
            both Kunti (Arjuna's mother)'s words and Draupadi's past-life decree, she would be married to all five Pandava brothers.
            This unique arrangement was not without its challenges. To maintain harmony, it was agreed that Draupadi would be wife to 
            each brother for a year in turn. 
            <br></br>
            Draupadi's marriage thus became a focal point of the Mahabharata, illustrating the interplay of fate, divine will, and human
             decisions. Her role as the shared wife of the five Pandavas would go on to influence many key events in the epic, 
             showcasing her strength, wisdom, and the complexities of duty in extraordinary circumstances.
