        <h2>The Birth of Draupadi</h2>
        <p>The story of Draupadi's birth in the Mahabharata is a tale of extraordinary circumstances, blending human emotions 
            with divine intervention. It shows a large community that good prevails and the strength of determination and loyalty. 
            <br></br>
            King Drupada of Panchala, feeling deeply wounded by the actions of his former friend Drona,
            sought a way to address his pain. In his quest for justice, he begged the gods above for a child who could right the perceived wrong. 
            The outcome of this ritual was truly remarkable. From the sacred flames emerged a fully-grown daughter of exceptional beauty, Draupadi. 
        
            <br></br>
            In a moment of rage, King Drupad cursed at the fires for giving him a daughter that would not be able to fight in a 
            war against his former friend and his army. In doing so, he cursed her life to be filled with sorrow and pain, depicted throughout 
            the epic Mahabharata. The fire then created another individual, Draupadi's brother Dhrishtadyumna, to appease King Drupad and kill Drona.

            The scripture depicts Draupadi as the most beautiful woman on the planet. It is also said that she is born to be the reason for the destruction of evil in this world.
            Throughout her life after birth, Draupadi fights on the good side and stays loyal to her friends and family despite all pain that is thrown 
            onto her. </p>
