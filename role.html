        <h2>Role of Draupadi in the Mahabharata</h2>
        <p>
            Draupadi was considered one of the most important characters in the Mahabharata, directly responsible for the win of good over evil. 
            She single-handedly kept the five Pandava brothers together as she was married to all of them, and brought to light the terrible nature of the 
            "evil" clan, the event that ultimately led to the final Mahabharata fight. 

            <h3>Draupadi's Five Husbands</h3>

            Draupadi's marriage with her five husbands allowed the family to stay together despite arguments that 
            arose through hardships and challenges. By staying loyal and together, the brothers were able to utilize their combined 
            strength during the final war against evil and did not work against each other. 

            <h3>Draupadi's Humiliation</h3>
            <img src="draupadi.jpg" alt="Draupadi" style="float:right;width:100px;">
            The oldest of the Pandava brothers, Yudhishthira, had a deep gambling addiction. One day when playing with Dushasana, a member of the evil team, he 
            kept loosing and continued to gamble away his life's earnings. When out of money, he began to gamble his chariots, kingdom, and finally, the 
            only thing he had left, his wife. Draupadi fought for her privacy and rights, but the evil side refused to listen and, in a show of power and 
            greed, began disrobing her in front of all elders in the court. She prayed to her best friend, Lord Krishna, who protected her by providing her infinite 
            cloth on her dress. Draupadi's desperate plea for justice in this moment not only saves her dignity (through divine intervention) but also sets the stage 
            for the eventual war between the Pandavas (good) and Kauravas (evil).

            This incident highlights Draupadi's role as a catalyst for action. Her public humiliation becomes a rallying point for the 
            Pandavas, fueling their determination to reclaim their lost kingdom and honor. Draupadi's vow to leave her hair unbound 
            until it can be washed in Dushasana's blood serves as a constant reminder of the injustice they faced, keeping the flames of
            vengeance alive throughout the years.

            <h3>Her Overall Role</h3>

            Throughout the epic, Draupadi serves as a voice of conscience and a symbol of unwavering strength. She frequently challenges her 
            husbands to live up to their warrior code and royal responsibilities, pushing them to action when they might otherwise have accepted their fate. 
            Her fiery spirit and sharp intellect make her a formidable presence, earning her the respect of allies and enemies alike.
